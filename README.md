🚀 Power BI Dashboard for Retail Sales Analysis 🚀

Proud to share this interactive Power BI dashboard that I developed to analyze retail sales data for a major brand, Blinkit – India's Last Minute App! 📊 This dashboard provides insights into key performance metrics such as:

💰 Total Sales and Average Sales
📦 Number of Items and Average Ratings
📈 Sales Trends by Outlet Establishment Year
